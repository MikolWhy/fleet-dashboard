# fleet-dashboard
Practice Project for ACF Associates Position (Disclaimer: This is not a project associated with ACF Associates in any way shape or form. This is purely a personal side project for practice based on personal research and goals aligning with my own purposes and thoughts.)
Goals are the practice the below:
React + Vite (frontend)
Recharts (data visualization)
Flask + Pandas (backend API)
Docker (containerization)
AWS (deployment)

#Development Workflow
Leveraging Claude and Cursor for detailed educational comments and guidance. Manually coding and running actionable steps with agentic planning, guidance, and explanations to simulate a productive pair-programming environment.

#Notes to self
- py commands work regardless of Python path since it always lives on C drive which is auto on path unlike Python cmd
- CRA (create react app) is depreciated since Feb 2025, so Vite is ideal going forward (hence this project lol)
